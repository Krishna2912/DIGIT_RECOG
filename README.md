# DIGIT_RECOG

This project is based on the recognition of digit using MNIST dataset, I trained this dataset using CNN model and test the trained model with the paint appliction. 
i just drawn the digit over there and make the predition as voice output.

####  important  ###

-> You need to save the trained CNN model as .h5 file.
-> you can see the main.py
-> Run this above code and get the prediction with voice

Another thing is the voice based output is saved in the file "predicted_digit_output.mp3" in mp3 format

I uploaded the sample images to test the trained model.

I HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU TO YOUR EXECUTION :)
